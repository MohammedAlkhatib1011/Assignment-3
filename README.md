The talk highlighted how critical analysis is in system development. It's clear that understanding user requirements, system design, testing, and implementation heavily relies on thorough analysis. Learning about the various roles in system analysis was enlightening. Each role has its unique focus, from understanding business needs and translating them into technical requirements, to ensuring data integrity and system functionality. The talk really helpful, especially when the speaker talked about the tools and technologies used in system development. They mentioned things like PostgreSQL for managing databases, and other software like Tableau or Python that are used for analyzing data.
